# Conventions: Weekly Value Boards

Read this before changing anything in this repo, and update it in the same pull request
whenever a convention changes. README.md describes the model and every section of the
boards in detail; this file is the rules.

- Live site: GitHub Pages, branch `main`, **repository root**
  - Landing page: https://rhyman7.github.io/fb-value-board/ (`index.html`)
  - NFL board: https://rhyman7.github.io/fb-value-board/docs/ (`docs/index.html`)
  - College board: https://rhyman7.github.io/fb-value-board/docs/cfb/ (`docs/cfb/index.html`)
- The matchup dashboards (rhyman7/nfl, rhyman7/cfb) and the Weekly Gridiron Board
  (rhyman7.github.io) are separate sites with their own CONVENTIONS.md.

## How changes get made

- **Pull requests only.** Never push or merge to `main` yourself: `main` is the live site.
  Open a pull request and wait for Ryan's approval. One topic per PR.
- **Both boards.** Design and feature changes go to both the NFL and the college board
  unless Ryan says otherwise. Don't call a change finished until both are done.
- **Ask first** if anything is unclear or a change could break the live site.
- **Kept separate for now.** Don't link the value boards from the matchup dashboards or
  rhyman7.github.io, and don't link those from here, until Ryan says otherwise.
- **What commits straight to `main`** (automated, not hand edits): the **Update board** and
  **Update college board** Actions (`.github/workflows/update.yml`, `update-cfb.yml`), which
  rebuild `docs/` and the committed files under `data/`. They share the `board-commits`
  concurrency group so they never push at once. Everything else goes through a PR.
- If a change touches what those Actions build or where it lands, check their steps and
  wording still match the site structure.

## Site structure

- `docs/index.html` and `docs/cfb/index.html` are **generated**. Don't edit them by hand;
  edit the template and rebuild:
  - NFL: `site/template.html`, built by `python run.py` (`--no-backtest` for a quick refresh)
  - College: `site/cfb-template.html`, which is itself generated from the NFL template by
    `python site/make_cfb_template.py`. Change `site/template.html`, then re-run that
    script; if it stops, fix the college substitution it names rather than editing
    `cfb-template.html` directly.
- The pipelines inject the week's data into the template in place of `/*__DATA__*/null`;
  keep that placeholder.
- `docs/archive/` holds each week's predictions frozen at kickoff. Never rewrite past weeks.
- Both boards share the same sections and anchors, in this order:
  Games `#games` | Players `#players` | Past weeks `#history` | Team ratings `#ratings` |
  Model record `#model`. Each board's nav links to the other board.
- Run `python -m pytest -q` before opening a PR that touches `nflmodel/`, `cfbmodel/` or
  the pipelines.

## Landing page (`index.html`)

- Titled **Weekly Value Boards**. Same layout, tokens, Archivo type and NCAA/NFL logos as
  the Weekly Gridiron Board (rhyman7.github.io); keep it styled consistently with it.
- College card on the left, NFL on the right. Each card links to its board and to the five
  sections above; if a section is added, renamed or reordered, update both cards.
- Logos live in `img/` (copies of rhyman7.github.io's `img/ncaa.png` and `img/nfl.png`).
- All links are relative (`docs/`, `docs/cfb/`, `img/`) so the page works at
  `/fb-value-board/`.
- A URL with a hash (e.g. `/fb-value-board/#games`) forwards to the NFL board, so links
  from when the root redirected there keep working. Keep that script.
- The Actions don't touch this file.

## Out of scope here

- This repo is the betting model as well as its site. Model, prediction and betting-logic
  work belongs to the CFB/NFL Model project; page, layout and landing-page work belongs to
  the Dashboards project.
- Every page keeps the disclaimer: for research and entertainment, past results do not
  predict future results, and nothing here is betting advice.
